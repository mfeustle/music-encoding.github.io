  <h2>Call for proposals</h2>

  <p>
    We are pleased to announce our call for papers, posters, panels, and
    workshops for the Music Encoding Conference 2024. The conference will be
    held 20-23 May 2024 at the
    <a href="http://www.unt.edu/" target="_blank">University of North Texas</a>
    in Denton.
  </p>

  <p>
    As an important cross-disciplinary venue for all who are interested in the
    digital representation of music, the Music Encoding Conference brings
    together members from various encoding, analysis, and music research
    communities, including musicologists, theorists, librarians, technologists,
    music scholars, teachers, and students, providing an opportunity for all
    participants to learn from and engage with each other.
  </p>

  <p>The deadline for all submissions is <strong>15 January 2024.</strong></p>

  <h4>Background</h4>

  <p>
    Music encoding is a critical component for fields and areas of study
    including computational musicology, digital musicology, digital editions,
    symbolic music information retrieval, digital libraries, digital pedagogy,
    and the wider music industry.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Music Encoding Conference has emerged as the foremost international
    forum where researchers and practitioners from across these varied fields
    can meet and explore new developments in music encoding. The Conference
    celebrates a multidisciplinary program, combining the latest advances from
    established music encoding projects, novel technical proposals and encoding
    extensions, and the presentation and evaluation of new practical
    applications of music encoding (e.g. in academic study, libraries, editions,
    pedagogy).
  </p>

  <p>
    Pre-conference workshops provide an opportunity to quickly engage with best
    practices in the community.
  </p>

  <p>
    Following the formal program, an unconference session will be held on May
    24, designed to foster collaboration in the community through the meeting of
    Interest Groups, and open participation in discussions on hot topics that
    emerge during the conference. Spaces for these meetings have been generously
    provided by the hosting institution. Please be in touch with conference
    organizers if you need to reserve these spaces. For meetings on other days
    during or immediately after the conference, availability can be checked upon
    request.
  </p>

  <p>
    The program welcomes contributions from all those working on, or with, any
    aspect of music encoding. Newcomers are encouraged to submit to the main
    program, demonstrating with articulations of the potential for music
    encoding in their work, and highlighting strengths and weaknesses of
    existing approaches within this context. In addition, the Conference serves
    as a focus event for the Music Encoding Initiative community, with its
    annual community meeting scheduled the day following the main program. We
    are particularly seeking to broaden the scope of musical repertories
    considered, and to provide a welcoming, inclusive community for all who are
    interested in this work.
  </p>

  <h4 id="submissions">Submissions</h4>
  <p>
    MEC 2024 will be accepting submissions in the following formats for the main
    conference programme (all submissions should include a short abstract,
    keywords and bio):
  </p>
  <p></p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Long papers:</strong> abstract 2-4 pages (1000-2000 words).
      <p>
        Long papers are expected to present overviews or detail specific aspects
        of ongoing or completed projects, detailed case-studies or elaborated
        perspectives on best practices in the field, or provide other reports on
        topics relevant to the conference.
      </p>
      <p>
        Speakers will be given 30 minutes each: 20 minutes for presentation, 10
        minutes for discussion.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Short papers:</strong> abstract 1-2 pages (500-1000 words).
      <p>
        Short papers are suitable for introducing tools, new ideas and
        experimental topics.
      </p>
      <p>
        Speakers will be given 15 minutes each: 10 minutes for presentation, 5
        minutes for discussion.

        projects, or software, or present experimental ideas for community
        feedback. A “poster slam” session will be dedicated to poster
        presentations of 1 minute each. Subsequently, poster presenters will
        have the chance to tell interested parties more about their project
        during the poster exhibition, where the audience can browse freely.
